# My Portfolio

## Summary
This portfolio website was designed for the final week project of term 1 at Coder Factory Academy. 
I have enjoyed this project and am proud of the outcome as it represents who I am and how I would like to be viewed.
Further changes will be constantly made to the site as my skills develop and design tastes change.

### Design Choice
I chose a light, friendly, vector themed site as it reflects my easygoing personality. I wanted to keep the site as minimal 
as possible to ensure viewers aren't overwhelmed by both content and imagery.

### Sources
- Background images - [Minimal Wallpapers](http://minimal-wallpapers.com)
  - NB: The background image for the third section 'Krem Clothing' was created by yours truly using a free online vector software
  [Vectr](https://vectr.com) that you should check out if you don't have access to Adobe Illustrator.
- Parallax scrolling - [How To: Parallax Scrolling](http://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_parallax.asp)
- Font - [Raleway Thin](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Raleway)

### HTML & CSS
I tried to keep the code as minimal as possible, avoiding external plugins and frameworks where possible. I had alot of fun
with the hover style, as you will see in the first three sections of the page.

### External Links
Whilst adding links to my LinkedIn and Github seemed necessary for potential employers, I also added my Twitter and Pinterest to show viewers more about my personality and my interests. I will eventually add a Codepen link once I have some projects in there.


1. All icons in the first section are links to my social media accounts. 
2. In the bio section the boxes and underlines are all links of some sort. The Krem Clothing box links to my online retail
label, the Resume box opens up my resume in a pdf in a new tab, clicking on my email address will open the default email client
for the user with my email address already prefilled into the 'to' box. And for those who read the personal info will see a
link to a great track I like to code to! Check it out.
3. All the letters of 'Krem Clothing' link to the same site.
4. No links in section 4, not yet anyways. Stay tuned!

### Process
1. I first drew up a rough draft of the framwork, seperating the different sections for the website. I knew from day one 
that I wanted it to be a single page, this is cleaner for mobile viewing.
2. Next I began drafting the base code for the site, creating necessary files and organising the folder structure. The base
code comprised of standard HTML tags, setting up a primary container div and then multiple content divs as a sub class of 
primary div. This structure was paramount in setting up parallax scrolling, which I found out later through much trial 
and error.
3. Once the container's were set up, I add background images to each one, testing a variety of combinations to see which
images worked the best together.
4. Next was adding headings to each section, pretty straightforward stuff. I spent some (too much) time getting the the 'hr'
line to be mobile responsive, in fact it's the only thing I'm using @media query for.
5. I spent alot of time on the icons on the first section, I originally wanted them bouncing around the container and bouncing
off each other whilst being links, but that was beyond my skills. I'm happy with how they look, and they are mobile responsive!
6. After the icons was the content, adding links, creating columns etc. 
7. Once all that was done, I finished up a few design options and voila!
